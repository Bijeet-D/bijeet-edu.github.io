IDK if puting the frames in a blob: does anything, becuase securly is kinda wierd with intercepting requests from iframes

List of blockers this kinda works with

- Securly

And probally more...

Dec. 2025 Note.

I discovered that iframes embeded in iframes don't get blocked by securly. That is the main reason why this works.

Later I may make a bigger embeding path so it may work for other blockers by confusing them.
